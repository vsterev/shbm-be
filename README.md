## Features

- **Hotel Management**: Manage hotels, accommodations, and mappings.
- **Booking Management**: Handle bookings, confirmations, and cancellations.
- **Integration**: Integrate with external services like HotelService and Interlook.
- **Authentication**: Secure endpoints using JWT and API tokens.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling for consistent API responses.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging using Winston.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hotel-parser-api.git
   cd hotel-parser-api
   '''

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Setup pm2 deployment

```bash
pm2 deploy production setup
```

4. Set up initial information and the environment variables:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

Setup mongo to work with replication
edit mongo.conf in ubunti it is located in /etc/monod.conf add row:

```bash
replication:
  replSetName: "rs0"
```

restart mongod

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mongod
```

should activate replica - run mongo client and type:

```bash
rs.initiate({
  _id: "rs0",
  members: [
    { _id: 0, host: "mongo1.example.com:27017" },
    { _id: 1, host: "mongo2.example.com:27017" },
    { _id: 2, host: "mongo3.example.com:27017" }
  ]
});

```

Set up inital information run

```bash
yarn initial-seed
```

5. Build the project

```bash
yarn build
```

6. Run in dev mode

```bash
yarn dev
```

7. PM2 deploy run locally

```bash
pm2 deploy ecosystem.config.cjs production
```

## Scripts

- yarn dev: Start the development server with hot-reloading.
- yarn build: Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
- yarn start: Start the production server.
- yarn lint: Run ESLint to check for code quality issues.
- yarn lint:fix: Automatically fix linting issues.
- yarn initial-seed: Populate intial information into mongo database.

## Git Hooks

This project uses Husky and lint-staged to maintain code quality and formatting before code is committed.
ü™ù Pre-Commit Hook
On each commit, the following checks are automatically run only on staged files:

- ‚úÖ ESLint ‚Äî catches common issues and potential bugs.
- ‚úÖ Prettier ‚Äî ensures consistent code formatting.
- ‚úÖ (Optional) TypeScript type checking ‚Äî for code safety.s
  This ensures that only clean and formatted code reaches your repository.

## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate code quality checks, enforce a clean Git history, and handle post-merge tasks.

‚úÖ Pull Request Checks
Three GitHub Actions are configured to streamline development and ensure code quality:

1. TypeScript and Linter Validation

   - Runs on every pull request.
   - Ensures:
     - TypeScript type checking
     - ESLint static analysis
   - Prevents type errors and enforces consistent coding standards.

2. Enforce Fast-Forward Merges

- (Optional / can be configured via branch protection)
- Ensures pull requests are merged using fast-forward only, avoiding merge commits.
- Maintains a clean, linear Git history.

üöÄ Automatic Post-Merge Actions 3. Post-Merge Automation

- Runs automatically after a pull request is merged into the default branch.
- Can be used for:
  - Triggering deployment
  - Running integration or end-to-end tests
  - Notifying external services
  - Syncing branches or documentation

These workflows help automate your CI/CD pipeline and reduce manual steps after code is merged.
